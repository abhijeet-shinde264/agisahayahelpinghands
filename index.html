    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 5em;" class="p1">CVSR Sahaya was started in the year 2009 by the students of CSE , under the guidance of Dr. G. Vishnu Murthy, HOD of CSE. 
      It started with an aim to provide support to the under privileged and needy of the society as a whole and with a more concentration on 
      such people in the surroundings of the college campus.
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5em;" class="p1">Though it started as an initiative by the students of CSE, it gradually spread throughout the college with its open ideology and 
        clear vision and became an amalgamation of the student community from all departments and all years making itself an institutional 
        organization than a departmental work.
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5em;" class="p1">In the course of its progress even Faculty from various departments became the members of Sahaya and took active part in their roles
           towards helping the society within their reach.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5em;" class="p1">Transparency and clarity of vision and mission of the organization are the assets that made Sahaya a very successful student 
             organization. The continuous dynamic leadership of various students over the years expanded the works of Sahaya from simple monetary 
             help to a few people to the level of a monthly support to orphanages and under privileged and also to adopting uncared kids.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5em;" class="p1">A detailed list of each work done by Sahaya is given below and Sahaya wishes to grow its reach and capabilities as high as 
               possible and be able to help as many as possible.
